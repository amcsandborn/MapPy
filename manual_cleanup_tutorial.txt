Manual Cleanup (QGIS or ArcGIS)

1. Add imagery and classified image to view
2. Create new shapefile > Polygon > UTM zone 
	a. Save as: City_YYYY_cleanup_class#_yourinitials.shp
	b. Example: Conakry_2013_cleanup_class1_AMCS.shp
3. Toggle Editing on and Draw polygons around areas that should be changed to class1
4. Add field called “CID” and add the class # that it should be changed to for every polygon
5. Toggle editing off and Save Edits
6. Repeat for all classes

Notes: 

* Spend about an hour zooming around to find big errors
* Things to keep an eye out for:
	- Airport runways will be misclassified as commercial >> cleanup as Other
	- Highways will be misclassified as commercial >> cleanup as Other
	- Areas of bright Soil may be misclassified as Commercial >> cleanup as Other
	- Coastal sand/waves may be misclassified as commercial >> cleanup as other
	- Other residential/commercial areas may need to be cleaned up as well that the classification may have missed.

Reclassifying Raster for Manual Cleanup areas (ArcGIS)

1. Reclassify Tool
	a. Input Raster: smoothed thematic classification
	b. Reclass Field: Value
	c. Click “Environments…” Tab > Raster Analysis
		i. Cell Size: Same as classification layer (must do this to keep the rasters snapped to each other)
		ii. Mask: your Cleanup shapefile (ex: Conakry_2013_cleanup_class1_yourinitials.shp)
	d. Reclassification:
		i. New Values all must be changed to the class of the cleanup polygons (see below)
	e. Output raster: conakry_2013_cleanup_class1_reclassify_yourinitials.img 
	f. Click Okay 
	g. Repeat for all 4 cleanup classes.
2. Mosaic to new Raster
	a. Input Rasters: all four cleanup rasters
	b. Output: Conakry_2013_cleanup_mosaic_all_yourinitials.img
	c. Spatial Reference: UTM zone
	d. Cell size: 20
	e. Number of bands: 1
	f. Click Okay
3. Mosaic the classification and the cleanup files together
	a. Input the classification first, then the cleanup mosaic image. 
	b. Same parameters as above
