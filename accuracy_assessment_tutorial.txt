Accuracy Assessment (ArcGIS)

1. Raster to Polygon: Nairobi_2008_rastertopoly.shp
2. Dissolve by Gridcode: Nairobi_2008_rastertopoly_dissolve.shp
3. Clip to AOI: Nairobi_2008_rastertopoly_dissolve_clip.shp 
4. Create Random Points: Nairobi_2008_acc_points200.shp
	a. 50 per class (200 total)
5. Open attribute table of points 
	a. Add field > ID_Class >>>> this is what the classification says it is
		i. Field Calculator > ID_CLASS = [CID] + 1
		ii. The CID class it makes for you is one number off (annoying…) so double check the points are in the right classes
	b. Add field > ID_Ref >>>> this will be what the original satellite imagery (the analyst) says it is
6. Edit ID_Ref column to say whatever class you believe it’s in
7. Open DBF in Excel
	a. Filter columns and count how many were correct
8. Accuracy_Assessment_Table_Worksheet.xlsx
	a. Pre-made table that you can just input your numbers into
